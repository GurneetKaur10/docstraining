                    have been indexed, which ones haven&#39;t, and any errors that Google has encountered.<br><br><span
                        style="font-weight:bold;">Crawl errors: </span>This tool helps you identify and fix any
                    technical issues that may be preventing Google from crawling your website properly. This includes
                    things like broken links, malformed HTML, and missing files.<br><br><span
                        style="font-weight:bold;">Mobile usability:</span> This tool helps you track how well your
                    website is performing on mobile devices. You can see how your pages are displayed on different
                    screen sizes, and you can get insights into how users are interacting with your website on

                    Console dashboard.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Javascript</span><br><br>JavaScript, often
                    abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide
                    Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It is used to create interactive web pages and web applications.
                    JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, meaning that it is executed by the user&#39;s web
                    browser. This makes it ideal for creating dynamic and interactive web pages that respond to user
                    input.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br>Key features and characteristics of JavaScript
                        include:</span><br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Syntax: </span>JavaScript uses a C-style
                    syntax with curly braces and semicolons to define code blocks and statements.<br><br><span
                        style="font-weight:bold;">Interactivity: </span>JavaScript enables the creation of interactive
                    elements such as buttons, forms, and animations that respond to user actions, enhancing the user
                    experience.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">DOM Manipulation:</span> JavaScript can interact
                    with the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page, allowing developers to access, modify, or delete
                    HTML elements and their attributes dynamically.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Event
                        Handling: </span>JavaScript can respond to various events triggered by user actions, like
                    clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs, allowing developers to create responsive
                    applications.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Asynchronous Programming:</span> JavaScript
                    supports asynchronous programming through mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and async/await. This
                    enables non-blocking operations, such as fetching data from a server, without freezing the user
                    interface.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Functions and Scope:</span> JavaScript allows
                    developers to define functions, organize code into reusable blocks, and manage variable scope to
                    avoid conflicts and improve code maintainability.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Data Types:
                    </span>JavaScript supports several data types, including strings, numbers, arrays, objects,
                    booleans, and more.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):
                    </span>JSON is a widely used data interchange format that closely resembles JavaScript object
                    syntax. It is commonly used for data exchange between web servers and clients.<br><br><span
                        style="font-weight:bold;">Third-Party Libraries and Frameworks:</span> JavaScript has a vast
                    ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, that simplify
                    web development and enable developers to build complex web applications more
                    efficiently.<br><br>It&#39;s important to note that JavaScript is not limited to front-end
                    development. With the advent of server-side frameworks like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for
                    back-end development, enabling full-stack development with a single programming
                    language.<br>JavaScript has become an essential language for modern web development due to its
                    ability to create dynamic and interactive web experiences. It continues to evolve with new language
                    features and standards, making it a versatile and powerful tool for building a wide range of web
                    applications and services.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Google Analytics</span><br>Google
                    Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google that allows website owners and marketers to
